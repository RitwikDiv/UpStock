	Builds predictive model and graphs it
	This function creates 3 models, each of them will be a type of support vector machine.
	A support vector machine is a linear seperator. It takes data that is already classified and tries
	to predict a set of unclassified data.
	So if we only had two data classes it would look like this
	It will be such that the distances from the closest points in each of the two groups is farthest away.
	When we add a new data point in our graph depending on which side of the line it is we could classify it
	accordingly with the label. However, in this program we are not predicting a class label, so we don't
	need to classify instead we are predicting the next value in a series which means we want to use regression.
	SVM's can be used for regression as well. The support vector regression is a type of SVM that uses the space between
	data points as a margin of error and predicts the most likely next point in a dataset.
	The predict_prices returns predictions from each of our models
